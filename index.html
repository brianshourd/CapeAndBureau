<p>THE WORLD IS IN PERIL. The Bureau of Civic Protection maintains an elite team of metahumans for just such an event. Your team. Can you save the world before it's too late?</p>
<p>Cape and Bureau RPG is a minimalist (the rules fit on a single page) superhero role-playing game written by Brian Shourd (<a href="http://brianshourd.com">brianshourd.com</a>), based on John Harper's <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf">Lasers and Feelings</a>. Designed for 2-6 players, 1 game master (GM), a handful of six-sided dice (d6), and little to no prep. Special thanks to Graham Starfelt, Auden Reiter, and rednightmare for great ideas.</p>

<h2 id="special-bifold-character-sheets">Special Bifold Character Sheets</h2>
<p>A couple of things that I find difficult in one-shot games (games like this one are best played as a single session or two, as opposed to a long-running campaign) are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understanding the other players' characters</li>
<li>Remembering the essential rules</li>
</ol>
<p>This character sheet is designed to help with that. There are two character sheets on a page, so first cut the page in half. Now each character sheet has some dotted lines. Fold on these dotted lines to get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/charsheets_folded.jpg" alt="A picture of the folded character sheet" /><figcaption>A picture of the folded character sheet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hooray! This acts kind of like a mini GM screen for all the players. It displays relevant information to the other players (like your name, emblem, and powers), but keeps personal information to yourself (like your number, motivation, and other notes). It also has a handy-dandy cheat sheet of rules on the back of the fold, so you can remember how many dice to roll and how to interpret them.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpg">What is an RPG?</h2>
<p>(If you've played a tabletop RPG before, you can skip this section.)</p>
<p>An RPG (acronym for <em>role-playing game</em>) is a game in which everyone playing works together to tell an interesting and fantastic story. One person is designated the <em>game master</em> (GM) and all the others are <em>players</em>. Every player designs and controls a single character (called a <em>player character</em> or PC) in the imaginary world of the game. You get to make every decision for your PC, and interact with the other PCs and the world for them. It's one part game and one part improv.</p>
<p>The GM is different. He/she doesn't control a PC. Instead, they control the environment and all of the other characters that the PCs meet in the world (these are called <em>non-player characters</em> or NPCs). The GM describes a situation that the PCs find themselves in, and then describe what happens when the characters perform actions in that scene. If the PCs want to ask an NPC for directions, the GM speaks for that NPC and decides how they react. If the PCs want to to fight, the GM decides how the NPCs fight back, or if they retreat.</p>
<p>What can a player character do? Pretty much anything they want. If it is something risky or that has an interesting chance of failure, the GM will ask you to roll some dice to determine what happens. If you want your character to convince the Mayor to build a particle accelerator in order to stop a global threat, you may or may not succeed, and the GM will have you explain the action and roll some dice. On the other hand, if you try to open an unlocked door, ask a stranger for directions, or drive a car, you generally don't need to roll dice. These are things that don't usually carry a large or interesting chance of failure. But under certain conditions they might, like if you are being chased by a werewolf or driving in a race. It all depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Even though a PC <em>can</em> do anything, that doesn't mean that they <em>should</em>. Interesting characters have motivations, feelings, and personalities, and they act according to those traits. Even when that isn't the &quot;best&quot; idea. Consistent and flawed characters are what make stories interesting. We read about Batman because of his strengths and his flaws. If he sometimes killed people but sometimes didn't, then all of the times that the Joker sets up an elaborate trick to get Batman to kill somebody, we simply wouldn't care. So if you play a scientist who undergoes a gamma-ray radiation accident and changes into a big green monster when he gets angry, you should play that up. In scientific scenarios, he may be awesome. In tense social situations, it may be all that you can do to keep from raging out.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is simply to have fun, and tell memorable tales together. Generally, the GM will come up with a threat that is bad for the world, and the heroes will try to stop that threat from succeeding. But this is simply a vehicle for telling an interesting and exciting story. It provides reasons to put the PCs into situations that are difficult to overcome, and NPCs for them to interact with who may have hidden agendas. Whether or not they defeat the threat is tangential to whether or not the everyone has a good time.</p>
<p>So do something awesome, let your character make bad decisions, and have fun.</p>

<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>
<p>Whenever your character tries to do something risky, roll 1d6 to find out how it goes. Roll +1d if you’re <em>prepared</em> and +1d if you’re an <em>expert</em>. The GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character's power, style, origin, and the situation. The GM also has final say on whether you are acting as a <em>cape</em> or as an <em>agent</em>. <em>Roll your dice and compare each die result to your number.</em></p>
<div class="colored">
<div class="grid">
<div class="unit one-of-two">

<h4 id="agent-roll-low">Agent (roll low)</h4>
<p>If you’re acting like an <em>agent</em> (plans, reason, detecting), you want to roll <em>under</em> your number. Rolling under your number is a <em>success</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="unit one-of-two">

<h4 id="cape-roll-high">Cape (roll high)</h4>
<p>If you’re acting like a <em>cape</em> (rapport, passion, intuition), you want to roll <em>over</em> your number. Rolling over your number is a <em>success</em>.</p>
</div>
</div> <!-- grid -->
</div> <!-- colored -->

<h3 id="classified-information">Classified Information</h3>
<p>If one or more dice roll exactly your number, you learn some <em>classified information</em>. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. Reroll those dice until they roll successes or failures. Some good questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are they really feeling? Who's behind this? How could I get them to do X? What should I be on the lookout for? What's the best way to do Y? What's really going on here?</p>

<p>If none of your dice succeed, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.</p>

<p>If one die succeeds, you barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost.</p>

<p>If two dice succeed, you do it well. Good job!</p>

<h3 id="helping">Helping</h3>
<p>If you want to help someone else who's rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them +1d.</p>
<h3 id="gm-run-the-game">GM: Run the Game</h3>
<p>Play to find out how the team defeats the threat. Uncover the truth as the game continues - keep the players guessing. Before a threat does something to the characters, show signs that it's about to happen, then ask them what they do. &quot;Electrometus raises his hands, crackling with electricity. What do you do?&quot; &quot;The brain worm is poised on Agent Ida's shoulder. What do you do?&quot;</p>
<p>Let the players use their team's boon to their advantage sometimes. Introduce complications because of their bane.</p>
<p>Call for a roll when the situation is uncertain. Don't pre-plan outcomes, and use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.</p>
<p>Ask questions and build on the answers. &quot;Have any of you encountered a Bear Tamer before? Where? What happened?&quot;</p>

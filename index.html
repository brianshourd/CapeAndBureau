<p>THE WORLD IS IN PERIL. The Bureau of Civic Protection maintains an elite team of metahumans for just such an event. Your team. Can you save the world before it's too late?</p>
<p>Cape and Bureau RPG is a minimalist (the rules fit on a single page) superhero role-playing game written by Brian Shourd (<a href="http://brianshourd.com">brianshourd.com</a>), inspired by John Harper's <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf">Lasers and Feelings</a>. Designed for 2-6 players, 1 game master (GM), a handful of dice, and little to no prep. Special thanks to Graham Starfelt, Auden Reiter, and rednightmare for great ideas.</p>

<h2 id="special-bifold-character-sheets">Special Bifold Character Sheets</h2>
<p>A couple of things that I find difficult in one-shot games (games like this one are best played as a single session or two, as opposed to a long-running campaign) are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understanding the other players' characters</li>
<li>Remembering the essential rules</li>
</ol>
<p>This character sheet is designed to help with that. There are two character sheets on a page, so first cut the page in half. Now each character sheet has some dotted lines. Fold on these dotted lines to get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/charsheets_folded.jpg" alt="A picture of the folded character sheet" /><figcaption>A picture of the folded character sheet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hooray! This acts kind of like a mini GM screen for all the players. It displays relevant information to the other players (like your name, emblem, and powers), but keeps personal information to yourself (like your number, motivation, and other notes). It also has a handy-dandy cheat sheet of rules on the back of the fold, so you can remember how many dice to roll and how to interpret them.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpg">What is an RPG?</h2>
<p>(If you've played a tabletop RPG before, you can skip this section.)</p>
<p>An RPG (acronym for <em>role-playing game</em>) is a game in which everyone playing works together to tell an interesting and fantastic story. One person is designated the <em>game master</em> (GM) and all the others are <em>players</em>. Every player designs and controls a single character (called a <em>player character</em> or PC) in the imaginary world of the game. You get to make every decision for your PC, and interact with the other PCs and the world for them. It's one part game and one part improv.</p>
<p>The GM is different. He/she doesn't control a PC. Instead, they control the environment and all of the other characters that the PCs meet in the world (these are called <em>non-player characters</em> or NPCs). The GM describes a situation that the PCs find themselves in, and then describe what happens when the characters perform actions in that scene. If the PCs want to ask an NPC for directions, the GM speaks for that NPC and decides how they react. If the PCs want to to fight, the GM decides how the NPCs fight back, or if they retreat.</p>
<p>What can a player character do? Pretty much anything they want. If it is something risky or that has an interesting chance of failure, the GM will ask you to roll some dice to determine what happens. If you want your character to convince the Mayor to build a particle accelerator in order to stop a global threat, you may or may not succeed, and the GM will have you explain the action and roll some dice. On the other hand, if you try to open an unlocked door, ask a stranger for directions, or drive a car, you generally don't need to roll dice. These are things that don't usually carry a large or interesting chance of failure. But under certain conditions they might, like if you are being chased by a werewolf or driving in a race. It all depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Even though a PC <em>can</em> do anything, that doesn't mean that they <em>should</em>. Interesting characters have motivations, feelings, and personalities, and they act according to those traits. Even when that isn't the &quot;best&quot; idea. Consistent and flawed characters are what make stories interesting. We read about Batman because of his strengths and his flaws. If he sometimes killed people but sometimes didn't, then all of the times that the Joker sets up an elaborate trick to get Batman to kill somebody, we simply wouldn't care. So if you play a scientist who undergoes a gamma-ray radiation accident and changes into a big green monster when he gets angry, you should play that up. In scientific scenarios, he may be awesome. In tense social situations, it may be all that you can do to keep from raging out.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is simply to have fun, and tell memorable tales together. Generally, the GM will come up with a threat that is bad for the world, and the heroes will try to stop that threat from succeeding. But this is simply a vehicle for telling an interesting and exciting story. It provides reasons to put the PCs into situations that are difficult to overcome, and NPCs for them to interact with who may have hidden agendas. Whether or not they defeat the threat is tangential to whether or not the everyone has a good time.</p>
<p>So do something awesome, let your character make bad decisions, and have fun.</p>

<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>Sometimes, when things don't go the way we want, there are consequences. A <em>Consequence</em> is something that happens to your character that makes life harder for them. They might be running out of willpower, bleeding, tired, confused, or losing their sanity.</p>
<p>Each time your character gets a consequence, mark a consequence box on your character sheet, and write down a description of the consequence. <em>Your maximum dice pool size is reduced by one</em>. That means that if you have no consequences, you can roll up to five d6s (see the section on rolling), but if you have one consequence, you can never roll more than four d6s, regardless of the action. If you have two consequences, you can't roll more than three d6s, and so on.</p>
<p>Your character can have at most <em>five</em> consequences before they are out of action (their dice pool size is reduced to 0). They might be dead, unconscious, or they may simply have given up. If every character reaches five consequences, the team is helpless, and they fail whatever their current objective was.</p>
<p>If it makes sense in the story, characters can sometimes remove consequences. This may require a roll (if e.g. someone has the Healer style), or it may not. Players may need to see a doctor, psycologist, shaman, or some other expert to remove their consequences, depending on the nature of the consequence.</p>
<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>
<p>Whenever your character tries to do something risky and there is both a reasonable and interesting chance of failure, you must roll some dice. Begin by describing your action and your goals in a cinematic and vivid way. The more exciting the description, the better.</p>
<p>For each <em>Attribute</em> (Power, Style, Origin, Motivation), if your description includes an explanation of how that attribute helps your character accomplish the action, you get to add a six-sided die (d6) to your dice pool. In addition, if your description was exceptionally vivid, cinematic, and all around cool, you get to add another d6 to your dice pool.</p>
<p>You can have up to five dice in your dice pool, unless you have taken <em>Consequences</em>. The maximum number of dice is reduced by one for each consequence your character has taken.</p>
<p>In addition to the d6s in your dice pool, you always get to roll the <em>Insight Die</em>, a 10-sided die.</p>
<p>That means that you always roll one d10 and between one and five d6s, but never more d6s than your character's current max.</p>
<h4 id="classified-information">Classified Information</h4>
<p>If the <em>Insight Die</em> matches any of the dice in your dice pool, you learn some <em>classified information</em>. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. Some good questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are they really feeling? Who's behind this? How could I get them to do X? What should I be on the lookout for? What's the best way to do Y? What's really going on here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only thing that the insight die is used for - it does not count towards the number of successes, and it doesn't count toward the maximum number of dice in your dice pool.</p>
<h4 id="interpreting-results">Interpreting Results</h4>
<p>For each d6 that shows a 5 or a 6, you get a success.</p>
<div class="colored">
<div class="grid">
<div class="unit one-of-four">

<h4 id="section">0</h4>
<p>If none of your d6s succeed, it goes wrong. Explain what went wrong, and give your character a <em>Consequence</em>.</p>

</div>
</div> <!-- grid -->
</div> <!-- colored -->

<h4 id="helping">Helping</h4>
<p>If you want to help someone else who's rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them an extra d6, but remember that they can never roll more than their maximum.</p>
<h3 id="gm-run-the-game">GM: Run the Game</h3>
<p>Play to find out how the team defeats the threat. Uncover the truth as the game continues - keep the players guessing.</p>
<p>Let the players use their team's boon to their advantage sometimes. Introduce complications because of their bane.</p>
<p>Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill.</p>
<p>Let each roll represent a large action or set of actions. Typical combats take only 1-2 rolls per player, at which point they can move on to something else.</p>
<p>Encourage players to be vivid in their descriptions - they should get the bonus description d6 on every roll. This isn't cheating, this is by design.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Bruce is playing Batman (Power: Gadgets, Style: Sneaker, Origin: Survivor, Motivation: Justice), who is trying to spy on a drug-deal between two rival gangs. Bruce says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I try to stay up high in the rafters, sneaking about and staying in the dark. Like a shadow, I glide silently from beam to beam, so quickly that anyone glancing up would only see a glimmer of night. I know that this information is of paramount importance if I'm going to bring down the Falcones, so I stay extra careful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This description makes it clear that Batman is using his style as a Sneaker and his motivation for Justice while attempting this action. In addition, the description was very vivid and exciting, so Bruce gets to roll 3 d6s (plus the Insight Die). Right now, Batman has one consequence, and so he has a maximum dice pool size of four. Three is less than four, so Bruce gets to roll all 3 dice. He rolls a 4, 4, and 2 on the d6s, and a 2 on the Insight die. That means he failed in his action, but that he learns some classified information. Before describing the failure, Bruce asks the GM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is in charge of the Falcone gang here tonight?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>GM: The pudgy guy near the van, smoking a cigarette, is Jonny Falcone, and he's supposed to be running tonight's deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because he failed the action, Bruce must describe how things go wrong and give himself a consequence. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as I get close enough to hear the deal, I see Jonny reach into his coat. While I'm focusing on what he is doing, I don't realize that the beam I am standing on was dusty, and some dust falls down onto the other men. One of the guys looks up. He shouts to his men that the Bat is here, and they start firing up into the rafters. I drop down behind the van, to keep out of their line of fire, but I can't help kicking myself for ruining this chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He takes the consequence &quot;Self-doubts and second-guesses&quot; and reduces his max dice pool size by one to three. Which is bad, since now all of the bad guys are coming after him.</p>

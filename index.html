<p>THE WORLD IS IN PERIL. The Bureau of Civic Protection maintains an elite team of metahumans for just such an event. Can you save the world before it's too late?</p>
<p>Cape and Bureau RPG is a minimalist (the rules fit on a single page) superhero role-playing game written by Brian Shourd (<a href="http://brianshourd.com">brianshourd.com</a>), inspired by John Harper's <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf">Lasers and Feelings</a>. Designed for 2-5 players, 1 game master (GM), a handful of dice (at least 5 six-sided and 1 10-sided), and little to no prep. The game can be played in 2-3 hours, including character creation. Special thanks to Graham Starfelt, Auden Reiter, and rednightmare for great ideas.</p>

<h2 id="special-bifold-character-sheets">Special Bifold Character Sheets</h2>
<p>A couple of things that I find difficult in one-shot games (games like this one are best played as a single session or two, as opposed to a long-running campaign) are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understanding the other players' characters</li>
<li>Remembering the essential rules</li>
</ol>
<p>This character sheet is designed to help with that. There are two character sheets on a page, so first cut the page in half. Now each character sheet has some dotted lines. Fold on these dotted lines to get something that looks kinda like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/charsheets_folded.jpg" alt="A picture of the folded character sheet" /><figcaption>A picture of the folded character sheet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hooray! This acts kind of like a mini GM screen for all the players. It displays relevant information to the other players (like your name, emblem, and powers), but keeps personal information to yourself. It also has a handy-dandy cheat sheet of rules on the back of the fold, so you can remember how many dice to roll and how to interpret them.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpg">What is an RPG?</h2>
<p>(If you've played a tabletop RPG before, you can skip this section.)</p>
<p>An RPG (acronym for <em>role-playing game</em>) is a game in which everyone playing works together to tell an interesting and fantastic story. One person is designated the <em>game master</em> (GM) and all the others are <em>players</em>. Every player designs and controls a single character (called a <em>player character</em> or PC) in the imaginary world of the game. You get to make every decision for your PC, and interact with the other PCs and the world for them. It's one part game and one part improv.</p>
<p>The GM is different. He/she doesn't control a PC. Instead, they control the environment and all of the other characters that the PCs meet in the world (these are called <em>non-player characters</em> or NPCs). The GM describes a situation that the PCs find themselves in, and then describe what happens when the characters perform actions in that scene. If the PCs want to ask an NPC for directions, the GM speaks for that NPC and decides how they react. If the PCs want to to fight, the GM decides how the NPCs fight back, or if they retreat.</p>
<p>What can a player character do? Pretty much anything they want. If it is something risky or that has an interesting chance of failure, the GM will ask you to roll some dice to determine what happens. If you want your character to convince the Mayor to build a particle accelerator in order to stop a global threat, you may or may not succeed, and the GM will have you explain the action and roll some dice. On the other hand, if you try to open an unlocked door, ask a stranger for directions, or drive a car, you generally don't need to roll dice. These are things that don't usually carry a large or interesting chance of failure. But under certain conditions they might, like if you are being chased by a werewolf or driving in a race. It all depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Even though a PC <em>can</em> do anything, that doesn't mean that they <em>should</em>. Interesting characters have motivations, feelings, and personalities, and they act according to those traits. Even when that isn't the &quot;best&quot; idea. Consistent and flawed characters are what make stories interesting. We read about Batman because of his strengths and his flaws. If he sometimes killed people but sometimes didn't, then all of the times that the Joker sets up an elaborate trick to get Batman to kill somebody, we simply wouldn't care. So if you play a scientist who undergoes a gamma-ray radiation accident and changes into a big green monster when he gets angry, you should play that up. In scientific scenarios, he may be awesome. In tense social situations, it may be all that you can do to keep from raging out.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is simply to have fun, and tell memorable tales together. Generally, the GM will come up with a threat that is bad for the world, and the heroes will try to stop that threat from succeeding. But this is simply a vehicle for telling an interesting and exciting story. It provides reasons to put the PCs into situations that are difficult to overcome, and NPCs for them to interact with who may have hidden agendas. Whether or not they defeat the threat is tangential to whether or not the everyone has a good time.</p>
<p>So do something awesome, let your character make bad decisions, and have fun.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>A <em>Consequence</em> is a thing that happens to your character that makes life harder. They could be running out of willpower, bleeding, tired, or losing their sanity.</p>
<p>When your character gets a consequence, mark a consequence box on your character sheet, and write down a short description. <em>Your Max Dice number is reduced by one for each consequence you have</em>.</p>
<p>Your character can only take five consequences before they are out of action. They might be dead, unconscious, or they may simply have given up. If every character reaches five consequences, the team is helpless, and they fail whatever their current objective was.</p>
<p>If it makes sense, characters can sometimes remove consequences. This may require a roll (if e.g. someone has the Healer style), or it may not, depending on the story and the consequence.</p>
<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>
<p>Whenever your character tries to do something and there is both a reasonable and interesting chance of failure, roll some dice. Describe your action and your goals in a cinematic and vivid way.</p>
<p>For each <em>Attribute</em> (Power, Style, Origin, Motivation), if your description explains some way that attribute helps to accomplish the action, you get to add a 6-sided <em>Action die</em> to your dice pool. In addition, if your description was exceptionally vivid, cinematic, or cool, you get to add another Action die to your dice pool.</p>
<p>You never roll more Action dice than than your <em>Max Dice</em> number.</p>
<h4 id="classified-information">Classified Information</h4>
<p>In addition to the Action dice, you always get to roll the <em>Insight die</em>, a 10-sided die. If the Insight die matches one or more Action dice, you learn some classified information. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are they really feeling? Who's behind this? How could I get them to do X? What should I be on the lookout for? What's the best way to do Y? What's really going on here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only thing that the Insight die is used for - it does not count towards the number of successes, nor does it count for <em>Max Dice</em>.</p>
<h4 id="interpreting-results">Interpreting Results</h4>
<p>Each Action die that rolls a 5 or 6 succeeds.</p>
<div class="colored">

<h4 id="helping">Helping</h4>
<p>If you want to help someone else who's rolling, explain how and make a roll. If you succeed, give them an extra Action die, but remember that they can never roll more than their <em>Max Dice</em>.</p>
<h3 id="gm-run-the-game">GM: Run the Game</h3>
<p>Play to find out how the team defeats the threat. Uncover the truth as the game continues - keep the players guessing.</p>
<p>Each roll represents a large action or set of actions. Combats take only 1-2 rolls per player. Use failures to push the action forward. The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill. Encourage players to be vivid in their descriptions - they should get the description d6 on every roll. This isn't cheating, this is by design.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Bruce is playing Catboy (Power: Gadgets, Style: Sneaker, Origin: Survivor, Motivation: Justice), who has been sent by the Bureau on a mission to spy on a drug deal between two rival gangs. Bruce says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I try to stay up high in the rafters, sneaking about and staying in the dark. Like a shadow, I glide silently from beam to beam, so quickly that anyone glancing up would only see a glimmer of night. I know that this information is of paramount importance if the Bureau is going to bring down the Quinn gang, so I stay extra careful.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This description clarifies that Catboy is using his style as a Sneaker and his motivation for Justice for this action. In addition, the description was vivid and exciting, so Bruce gets to roll 3 Action dice. Catboy has only one consequence, and so his Max Dice is 4, which doesn't interfere in this case. Bruce rolls, getting 4, 4, and 2 on the Action dice, and a 5 on the Insight die. That means he failed in his action, and he also doesn't learn any classified information. Bruce describes the failure, and how it moves the action forward in the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just as I get close enough to hear the deal, I see Jonny Quinn reach into his coat. While I'm focusing on Jonny, I ignore the dust on the rafter, and some falls down onto the other men. One of them looks up. He shouts to his men that the Cat is here, and they start firing up into the rafters. I drop down behind the van, to keep out of their line of fire, but I can't help kicking myself for ruining this chance.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bruce takes the consequence &quot;Self-doubts and second-guesses&quot; and reduces his Max Dice to 3.</p>
